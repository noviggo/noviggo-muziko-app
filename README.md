## Purpose

The Noviggo Muziko open-source audio player is intended to be a starting point for building an offline audio player leveraging React Native.  It was created to explore the following use cases.

* Integrating with the native device's media library to build an local metadata database to catalog an audio library and keep a player queue.

* Reading local file information to extract music metadata to create a catalog.

* Augmenting metadata about an artist, album, or track leveraging Spotify's web APIs.

* Integrating with the native devices audio playback abilities.

## Getting Started

Ensure [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) is installed globally prior to starting, and a emulator/local device is setup for development, project has only been tested on Android for now, IOS testing will begin in the near future.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Build and start

```bash
npm run android
```

## Known limitations

* Library sync scanning is slow to process information (.5 seconds per file).
* Library sync UX is a work in progress.
* Library scanning is depending on the local devices media library being up to date, on Android the native library scan can be triggered by a device restart.
* Queue functionality is limited, more use cases will be built in the future.
* Only supports .ogg, .mp3, .flac files initially for scanning tag metadata, updates will be included in the future to support more audio types.
* If the systems color mode is changed while the app is running, the updated color scheme will only be applied after the app is restarted.
